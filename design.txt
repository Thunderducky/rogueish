Asteroid Story

There is an asteroid that was captured, put in Earth orbit, which is now set with a collision course with the planet
You can either save the planet or just try to get out alive.

1. Escape ** <- Prototype
  Shuttles
  Space Suit Chance

2. Deflection
  Move it out of the way of the earth
    Rocket Burn,
    Detonation,
    atmospheric skidding

3. Asteroid Capture
  This scenario would only work if the asteroid wasn't captured already


  Prototype #1
    Find Spacesuit, Radio for help, get to docking station


Very short game, we don't want to take up to much of people's time
Fast Run - 5 minutes
Average Run - 10 minutes
Intro Run - 15 minutes

First Mode
  Civilian
    (No Combat, No Equipment except Suit, Generous Time Limit, Can only Escape)
    Things you can do
      Cycle Airlocks - Very simple implementation
      Open Close Doors
      Explore Station
      The occasional Spacewalk
      No Jetpack
      Could make it a very designed experience I suppose, if they want to know the map well, it could
      be the damage that varies, but the place eventually gets well known

  Game Sequence
    Setup
      Generate Geometry
      Place Items
      Place Camera, have Camera track player
      Generate Power Grid
      // TODO: Allow a hardcoded version of the map
      // TOOLS: Make a map editor & loader
      // this is good because it'll let me try things
      // it'll also let people save/share maps

      // Let's also make a tool that can store things in local storage
      // Also, let's make a multi-entry point for webpack, but they can leverage similar libraries

      Data
        Level Geometry Data    <-  Generate
                                -  Serialize
                                -  Deserialize
        Connection Data
        Fov Data
        Air Data
        Render Data

        At the beginning during setup all of this will be calculated ahead of time
